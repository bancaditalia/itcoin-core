#
# Itcoin
#
# Entrypoint for the docker container of itcoin-core.
# Allows starting an arbitrary linux command inside the container.
#
# If the command is a itcoin-specific one (for example "bitcoind" or
# "bitcoin-cli"), the startup procedure is different: before launching the
# command, a configuration file is created via environment variable
# interpolation and placed at /opt/itcoin-core/configdir/bitcoin.conf. The
# requested itcoin binary is then launched pointing at that file, and at a fixed
# datadir (/opt/itcoin-core/datadir). Any additional command line parameters are
# then passed to the binary.
#
# This allows configuring itcoin components via enviromnent variables, even if
# the bitcoin binaries do not support it.
#
# USAGE:
#     entrypoint.sh --help
#     entrypoint.sh <bitcoind, bitcoin-cli> [ parameters... ]
#     entrypoint.sh somecommand [ parameters... ]
#
# EXAMPLE:
#    docker run --rm arthub.azurecr.io/itcoin-core:git-2a43646f76e4 --help
#    docker run --rm --env BLOCKSCRIPT=XXX <more variables...> arthub.azurecr.io/itcoin-core:git-2a43646f76e4 bitcoin-cli -help
#    docker run --rm arthub.azurecr.io/itcoin-core:git-2a43646f76e4 cat /etc/passwd

set -eu

# This is the set of environment variables that will be supported by the itcoin
# container when running some bitcoin-specific commands.

	USAGE:

	entrypoint.sh < [--help|-H] | command [parameters...] >

	You have to invoke this container passing the name of a command to execute.
	The command can be any binary existing in the container, including the ones
	specific for itcoin, which are:
	$(printf "    - %s\n" $(ls -1 /usr/local/bin))

	Additionally, for the following commands:
	    - bitcoind
	    - bitcoin-cli
	    - miner

	A dynamic runtime configuration will be performed. This REQUIRES that the
	following environment variables are set:
	$(printf "    - %s\n" "${SUPPORTED_VARIABLES[@]}")

	Before executing any bitcoin-cli or miner commands, the container will issue
	a health check (bitcoin-cli uptime) against the configured itcoin-core
	container at RPC_HOST:RPC_PORT.
	If the health check fails, the container exits and no other actions are
	taken, otherwise the container proceeds to execute the requested command.

	Please note that, inside the container, the configuration file will be
	separated form the data directory (this is different from default bitcoin
	behaviour):
	    - datadir:       ${INTERNAL_DATADIR}
	    - configuration: ${INTERNAL_CONFIG_DIR}/bitcoin.conf

	These directories ARE NOT PRESENT in the container: you will have to provide
	them at execution time.
	    - datadir must be a bind mount on a physical directory on the host
	    - ${INTERNAL_CONFIG_DIR} must be a tmpfs mount that will host an
	      ephemeral configuration file, generated at runtime
	USAGE
